DICe is an open source digital image correlation (DIC) tool intended for use as a module in an external application or as a standalone analysis code. Its primary capability is computing full-field displacements and strains from sequences of digital images. These images are typically of a material sample undergoing a characterization experiment, but DICe is also useful for other applications (for example, trajectory tracking). DICe is machine portable (Windows, Linux and Mac) and can be effectively deployed on a high performance computing platform (DICe uses MPI parallelism as well as threaded on-core parallelism). Capabilities from DICe can be invoked through a customized library interface, via source code integration of DICe classes or through a standalone executable.

DICe is different than other available DIC codes in the following ways:

First, subsets can be of arbitrary shape. This enables tracking of oblong objects that otherwise would not be trackable with a square subset.

DICe also incudes a robust simplex optimization method that does not use image gradients (this method is useful for data sets that are impossible to analyze with the traditional Lucas-Kanade-type algorithms, for example,  objects without speckles, images with low contrast, and small subset sizes < 10 pixels).

Lastly, DICe also includes a well-posed global DIC formulation that addresses instabilities associated with the saddle-point problem in DIC (This capability will be released later this year).
